Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from Scratch for Machine Learning

Overview:

This repository contains an implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch using Python. 
PCA is a widely used technique in machine learning for dimensionality reduction, which helps reduce the complexity of data while retaining as much information as possible. 
This implementation includes both the math and code required to understand and build PCA from the ground up.

Features:

-> Custom PCA class that can be used for dimensionality reduction.

-> Code that explains the mathematical concepts behind PCA (eigenvalues and eigenvectors).

-> A fit_transform method for fitting and transforming data.

-> An inverse_transform method to reconstruct data for visualization.

-> Example usage on the MNIST dataset to demonstrate data reduction from 784 to 50 dimensions.
